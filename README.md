## Features

This is a Teams and Office personal Tab app using SSO and Microsoft Graph
* Using SSO with Teams JS SDK 2.0
* Using O-B-O flow secure and totally in backend to retrieve and store data via Microsoft Graph
* [Extend Teams apps across Microsoft 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/m365-apps/overview?WT.mc_id=M365-MVP-5004617)
* [Use FluentUI React Northstar List and Dialog](https://fluentsite.z22.web.core.windows.net/)
* [Upload small (<4MB) DriveItem with Microsoft Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/driveitem-put-content?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http&WT.mc_id=M365-MVP-5004617)
* [Upload large (>4MB) DriveItem with Microsoft Graph in resumable upload](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/driveitem-createuploadsession?view=graph-rest-1.0&WT.mc_id=M365-MVP-5004617) 
* [Read and store custom data with message object featuring Microsoft Graph openExtensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/opentypeextension?view=graph-rest-1.0&WT.mc_id=M365-MVP-5004617)

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in the `.env` file.

## Debug and test locally

To debug and test the solution locally you use the `serve` Gulp task. This will first build the app and then start a local web server on port 3007, where you can test your Tabs, Bots or other extensions. Also this command will rebuild the App if you change any file in the `/src` directory.

``` bash
gulp serve
```

To debug the code you can append the argument `debug` to the `serve` command as follows. This allows you to step through your code using your preferred code editor.

``` bash
gulp serve --debug
```

* [Debugging with Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/pnp/generator-teams/blob/master/docs/docs/user-guide/vscode.md)
* [Developing with ngrok](https://github.com/pnp/generator-teams/blob/master/docs/docs/concepts/ngrok.md)
* [Developing with Github Codespaces](https://github.com/pnp/generator-teams/blob/master/docs/docs/user-guide/codespaces.md)

## Additional build options

You can use the following flags for the `serve`, `ngrok-serve` and build commands:

* `--no-linting` or `-l` - skips the linting of Typescript during build to improve build times
* `--debug` - builds in debug mode and significantly improves build time with support for hot reloading of client side components
* `--env <filename>.env` - use an alternate set of environment files
* `--publish` - automatically publish the application to the Teams App store

## Deployment

The solution can be deployed to Azure using any deployment method.

* For Azure Devops see [How to deploy a Yo Teams generated project to Azure through Azure DevOps](https://www.wictorwilen.se/blog/deploying-yo-teams-and-node-apps/)
* For Docker containers, see the included `Dockerfile`

## Logging

To enable logging for the solution you need to add `msteams` to the `DEBUG` environment variable. See the [debug package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) for more information. By default this setting is turned on in the `.env` file.

Example for Windows command line:

``` bash
SET DEBUG=msteams
```

If you are using Microsoft Azure to host your Microsoft Teams app, then you can add `DEBUG` as an Application Setting with the value of `msteams`.
